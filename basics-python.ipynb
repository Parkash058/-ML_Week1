    "### Comparison Operators\n",
    "In Python, we can use comparison operators to compare values. When a comparison is made, Python returns a boolean result, or simply a True or False. \n",
    "\n",
    "To check if two values are the same, we can use the equality operator: == \n",
    "\n",
    "To check if two values are not the same, we can use the not equals operator: != \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also check if values are greater than or lesser than each other using > and <. If you try to compare data types that arenâ€™t compatible, like checking if a string is greater than an integer, Python will throw a TypeError. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can make very complex comparisons by joining statements together using logical operators with our comparison operators. These logical operators are and, or, and not. When using the and operator, both sides of the statement being evaluated must be true for the whole statement to be true. When using the or operator, if either side of the comparison is true, then the whole statement is true. Lastly, the not operator simply inverts the value of the statement immediately following it. So if a statement evaluates to True, and we put the not operator in front of it, it would become False."

    "### Anatomy of a While Loop\n",
    "A while loop will continuously execute code depending on the value of a condition. It begins with the keyword while, followed by a comparison to be evaluated, then a colon. On the next line is the code block to be executed, indented to the right. Similar to an if statement, the code in the body will only be executed if the comparison is evaluated to be true. What sets a while loop apart, however, is that this code block will keep executing as long as the evaluation statement is true. Once the statement is no longer true, the loop exits and the next line of code will be executed. "

    "As we've called out earlier writing loops allows us to get our computer to do repetitive work for us. So this is one of the main benefits of writing scripts in IT is to save time by automating repetitive tasks, loops are super useful. So let's make sure you avoid some of the most common mistakes people make when writing loops. One of the most common errors is forgetting to initialize variables with the right value. We've all made this mistake when starting to code. Remember how in the earlier examples we initialized our variable x to 0 in one case and to one in the other. When we forget to initialize the variable two different things can happen the first possible outcome and the easiest to catch is that Python might raise an error telling us that we're using a variable we haven't defined, which looks like this. As we've done with other errors we've come across, we can look at the last line to understand what's going on. This error type is a name error and the message that comes after it says we're using an undefined variable. It's straightforward to fix, we just need to initialize the variable before using it like this,\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed. Now, there's a second issue we might face if we forget to initialize variables with the right value. We might have already used the variable in our program. In this case, if we reuse the variable without setting the correct value from the start, it will still have the value from before. This can lead to some pretty unexpected behavior. Check out the script, can you spot the problem? In the first block, we correctly initialize x to 1 and sum to 0 and then iterate until x equals 10 summing up all the values in between. So by the end of that block, sum equals the result of adding all the numbers from 1 to 10 and x is 10. In the second part of the code, the original intention was to get the product of all the numbers from 1 to 10, but if you look closely, you can see that we're initializing product but forgetting to initialize x. So x is still 10, this means that when the while condition gets checked, x is already 10 at the start of the iteration. The while condition is false before it even starts and the body never executes. Let's see how this problem would look.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, it might be harder to catch the problem because python doesn't raise an error. The problem here is that our product variable has the wrong value. If you have a loop that's gone rogue and not behaving as expected, it's a good idea to check if all the variables are correctly initialized. In this example, we need to set x back to 1 before starting the second loop. As always, the best way to learn is to practice it yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Makes sense? Remember, if you ever feel stuck or a little unsure about something you can always ask for help in the discussion forums. These forums are there to let you get the help you need when you need it, so don't forget to use them. So, to recap, whenever you're writing a loop check that you're initializing all the variables you want to use before you use them. And don't worry if you don't get it right the first time, we've all been there when learning how to code. As we've called out before, the way to master programming is to practice, practice, practice. Keep practicing until you're comfortable and even then it's still okay to make mistakes. So don't feel like you can't or loop back around to review and practice everything we've covered so far."

    "#### Common Pitfalls With Variable Initialization\n",
    "You'll want to watch out for a common mistake: forgetting to initialize variables. If you try to use a variable without first initializing it, you'll run into a NameError. This is the Python interpreter catching the mistake and telling you that youâ€™re using an undefined variable. The fix is pretty simple: initialize the variable by assigning the variable a value before you use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common mistake to watch out for that can be a little trickier to spot is forgetting to initialize variables with the correct value. If you use a variable earlier in your code and then reuse it later in a loop without first setting the value to something you want, your code may wind up doing something you didn't expect. Don't forget to initialize your variables before using them!"

    "You may remember by now that while loops use the condition to check when to exit. The body of the while loop needs to make sure that the condition being checked will change. If it doesn't change, the loop may never finish and we get what's called an infinite loop, a loop that keeps executing and never stops. Check out this example. It uses the modulo operator that we saw a while back. This cycle will finish for positive and negative values of x. But what would happen if x was zero? The remainder of 0 divided by 2 is 0, so the condition would be true. \n",
    "\n",
    "The result of dividing 0 by 2 would also be zero, so the value of x wouldn't change. This loop would go on for ever, and so we'd get an infinite loop. If our code was called with x having the value of zero, the computer would just waste resources doing a division that would never lead to the loop stopping. The program would be stuck in an infinite loop circling background endlessly, and we don't want that. All that looping might make your computer dizzy. To avoid this, we need to think about what needs to happen for a loop to be successful. In this example, we said that x needs to be different than zero. So we could nest this while loop inside an if statement just like this. With this approach, the while loop is executed only when x is not zero. Alternatively, we could add the condition directly to the loop using a logical operator like in this example. \n",
    "\n",
    "This makes sure we only enter the body of the loop for values of x that are both different than zero and even. Talking about infinite loop reminds me of one of the first times I used while loops myself. I wrote a script that emailed me as a way of verifying that the code worked, and while some condition was true, I forgot to exit the loop. Turns out those e-mails get sent faster than once per second. As you can imagine, I got about 500 e-mails before I realized what was going on. Infinitely grateful for that little lesson. When you're done laughing at my story, remember, when you're writing loops, it's a good idea to take a moment to consider the different values a variable can take. This helps you make sure your loop won't get stuck. If you see that your program is running forever without finishing, have a second look at your loops to check there's no infinite loop hiding somewhere in the code. While you need to watch out for infinite loops, they are not always a bad thing. Sometimes you actually want your program to execute continuously until some external condition is met. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you've used the ping utility on Linux or macOS system, or ping-t on a Windows system, you've seen an infinite loop in action. This tool will keep sending packets and printing the results to the terminal unless you send it the interrupt signal, usually pressing Ctrl+C. If you were looking at the program source code, you'll see that it uses an infinite loop to do this with a block of code with instructions to keep sending the packets forever. One thing to call out is it should always be possible to break the loop by sending a certain signal. In the ping example, that signal is the user pressing Ctrl+C. In other cases, it could be that the user pressed the button on a graphical application, or that another program sent a specific signal, or even that a time limit was reached. In your code, you could have an infinite loop that looks something like this. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we use the break keyword which you can see here to signal that the current loop should stop running. We can use it not only to stop infinite loops but also to stop a loop early if the code has already achieved what's needed. So quick refresh. How do you avoid the most common pitfalls when writing while loops? First, remember to initialize your variables, and second, check that your loops won't run forever. Wow. All this talk of loops is making me feel a little loopy. I'm going to have to go and lie down while you do the next practice quiz. Best of luck, and meet me over in the next video when you're done."
